## Hello world 👋
I'm Kathy. 
Started my journey in Taiwanese Literature, where I learned to value language, history, humanity, and critical thinking.  
Curiosity about data led me into analytics, and turned into AI engineering in my last year of university.  
Now at NUS MTech AI Systems, I focus on building knowledge and practice that connect human acumen with computational power.  
I enjoy and hope to bridge humanistic thinking with technical problem-solving into impact!
